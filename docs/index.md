## Getting Started

To get started with the Constellation Backend API, you will need to have the following:

- An API key or access token for authentication.
- The base URL for the API endpoints.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a JWT token. You can obtain a token by logging in with your credentials.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Common status codes include:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `201 Created`: The resource was successfully created.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.
- `403 Forbidden`: Authentication succeeded but authenticated user does not have access to the requested resource.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server.
